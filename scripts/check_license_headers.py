"""Verify that every tracked source file carries the Apache 2.0 preamble.

Checks Python, shell, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML files. Comment syntax differs per
language, so the header is matched against a comment-stripped, whitespace-
collapsed view of the top of each file. Exits non-zero if any file is missing
the preamble.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/check_license_headers.py            # every tracked file
    python3 scripts/check_license_headers.py a.py b.js  # only the given files
